Canvas inspect
==============
Canvas inspect is a wrapper around the html5 canvas context. It records state changes and function calls to the context object that then can be replayed later.

Usage
=====

```js
//Get the canvas element and wrap its context.
var canvas = document.getElementById("screen"),
    ctx = wrapContext(canvas.getContext("2d"));

//Record some state changes and function calls
ctx.startRecording();
ctx.fillStyle = "#f00";
ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 800, 600);
ctx.stopRecording();

//Replay the last frame with 1 second delay between function calls.
ctx.replayFrame(-1, 1000);
```

Todo
====
  - Examples with GUI
  - Saving frames to JSON.
